## 🌍 About Me
I'm a Cuban entrepreneur living in Phuket, Thailand. I speak Spanish, English, and Russian fluently. I have a strong interest in tech, cybersecurity, and business development. Currently reconnecting with my spiritual path as a practicing Catholic.

## 🎯 Objective
My journey in technology and entrepreneurship has sparked a strong interest in cybersecurity. I am currently building my skills through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, with plans to pursue **Security+, CEH, AWS Solutions Architect**, and eventually **CISSP, DevSecOps, and OSCP**. My goal is to grow as a cybersecurity professional, contributing to security operations, DevSecOps projects, and innovative security solutions.
